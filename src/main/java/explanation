This is a Java code that demonstrates the usage of the ternary operator. The ternary operator is an operator in Java programming language that takes three arguments or operands: a Boolean expression, a value to be returned if the Boolean expression is true, and another value to be returned if the Boolean expression is false.

The code starts by declaring two integer variables a and b, which are assigned values of 10 and 20 respectively.

The first example (Example 1) uses the ternary operator to find the minimum value between a and b. It creates a new integer variable min and assigns it the result of the ternary operator (a < b) ? a : b. If a < b, a is assigned to min, otherwise b is assigned to min. Then the min value is printed using System.out.println().

The second example (Example 2) shows how nested ternary operators can be used to assign different values based on multiple conditions. It finds the max value between a and b and creates a new integer variable max. If a > b, a is assigned to max. Otherwise, the ternary operator ((a == b) ? 0 : b) is evaluated. Here, if a is equal to b, then 0 is assigned to max, else b is assigned to max. Finally, the max value is printed using System.out.println().

The third example (Example 3) shows how the result of a ternary operator can be assigned to a string variable. It creates a new string variable result and assigns it the result of the ternary operator. If a > b, then the string "a is greater than b" is assigned, else the string "b is greater than or equal to a" is assigned. Then the result value is printed using System.out.println().

Finally, the fourth example (Example 4) shows how the ternary operator can be used inside a println() statement without assigning its result to a variable. The maximum value between a and b is printed in a single line statement. Inside println(), we use ternary operator to show maximum value: (a>b)? a:b" means if a is greater than b then print "a" otherwise print "b".
